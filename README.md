### Project Title
TMDb Movie Data Investigation

### Description
In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing information of about 10,000 movies from The Movie Database (TMDb). Using Python libraries like NumPy and pandas within a Jupyter Notebook, I explored the data to uncover insights about movie release trends and actor roles.

Key insights include:

* Films are more likely to be released at the end of the year, particularly in September, October, November, and December.
* Male actors are more frequently cast in multiple roles, with 9 out of 10 top appearances being men.
* Over the years, films have seen a general increase in popularity, showing exponential growth despite outliers in the 70s.

### Limitations
While the dataset provides valuable insights, it contains only about 10,000 films, whereas approximately 100,000 films have been created, indicating that the conclusions may not represent the entire film industry.
